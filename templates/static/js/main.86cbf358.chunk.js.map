The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Sidenav, you have to add a node.\r\n  7. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Sidenav that contains other routes\r\n  inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\r\n  8.
