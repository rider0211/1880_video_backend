The `key` key is used for the key of the route (It will help you with the key prop inside a loop).\r\n  6. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Sidenav, you have to add a node.\r\n  7. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Sidenav that contains other routes\r\n  inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\r\n  8. The `route` key is used to store the route location which is used for the react router.\r\n  9. The `href` key is used to store the external links location.\r\n  10. The `title` key is only for the item with the type of `title` and its used for the title text on the Sidenav.\r\n  10.
