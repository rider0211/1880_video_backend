Once you add a new route on this file it will be visible automatically on\r\n  the Sidenav.\r\n\r\n  For adding a new route you can follow the existing routes in the routes array.\r\n  1. The `type` key with the `collapse` value is used for a route.\r\n  2. The `type` key with the `title` value is used for a title inside the Sidenav. \r\n  3. The `type` key with the `divider` value is used for a divider between Sidenav items.\r\n  4. The `name` key is used for the name of the route on the Sidenav.\r\n  5. The `key` key is used for the key of the route (It will help you with the key prop inside a loop).\r\n  6. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Sidenav, you have to add a node.\r\n  7. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Sidenav that contains other routes\r\n  inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\r\n  8. The `route` key is used to store the route location which is used for the react router.\r\n  9. The `href` key is used to store the external links location.\r\n  10. The `title` key is only for the item with the type of `title` and its used for the title text on the Sidenav.\r\n  10. The `component` key is used to store the component of its route.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// React icons\r\nimport { IoFilmSharp, IoPeopleSharp } from \"react-icons/io5\";\r\nimport { PiFilmReelFill } from
